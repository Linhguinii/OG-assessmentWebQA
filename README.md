# OG-assessmentWebQA

Goal : Testing Spotify's web player.

I followed a Page Object model which we can see in the src folder.

I made a seperate folder for the tests where I test each functionality of the web player by toggling no other function except the one being tested.
In the Bonus Test, I go outside of the specfied section and use the name of the song and the album to verify the previous function while using multiple basic functions.

I use the "wait" method to confirm the changes happening and "assertEquals" when necessary.

The information to filled is where the "TODO" comments are.
